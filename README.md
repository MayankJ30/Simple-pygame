##Simple arcadegame made using Pygame!

I made this game to practice my python and learn a little of pygame along the way :)
###Installation instructions - 

* Install Python 2.7 or older. Feel free to try it out on Python 3.x and do tell me if it works.
* Install Pygame (latest version should work)
* Download all files (inculding resources and the font)
* Run ````game.py```` and Enjoy!

Note - If you have py2exe installed, ````setup.py```` can be used to create an executable.

#####Disclaimer - None of the graphics and the sounds are my own.
